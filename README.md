The first basemap is stylized to look rustic with the canvas and yellowish background. This map uses the anders font stylization to make it seems more thematic. The yellow color is meant to take the focus away from natural areas and show the complex urban and transportation networks. It was derived from the original light map style. The motivation I had for this map was inspired by oldd maps that were produced on canvas or paper that have begun to age. It is intended for someone who may be traveling with no real need to admire natural features. The font sytle in particular is meant to modernized this old look to have a steampunk feel. This was partially inpsired from the Bioshock video same series.

**Basemap 2** - Formal Nature

The second base map is stylized from the original dark map style. This map uses the Market Deco font style. The dark backgound is used to drak attention away from uban areas and highlight areas of vegetation, recreation, and other natural features using shares of green, blue, and yellow. By using dark colors and a dark background encourges the map and its focus on the natural features to be taken seriously. Areas of industry are displayed in a lighter tone to distinguih the urban areas. Becasue thse are small areas they do not force the areas to be as prevalent on the map.
